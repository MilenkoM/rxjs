/**
 *
 * Queue Scheduler
 *
 * <span class="informal">Put every next task on a queue, instead of executing it immediately</span>
 *
 * `queue` scheduler, when used with delay, behaves the same as {@link asyncScheduler} scheduler.
 *
 * When used without delay, it schedules given task synchronously - executes it right when
 * it is scheduled. However when called recursively, that is when inside the scheduled task,
 * another task is scheduled with queue scheduler, instead of executing immediately as well,
 * that task will be put on a queue and wait for current one to finish.
 *
 * This means that when you execute task with `queue` scheduler, you are sure it will end
 * before any other task scheduled with that scheduler will start.
 *
 * ## Examples
 * Schedule recursively first, then do something
 * ```javascript
 * import { queueScheduler } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * queueScheduler.schedule(() => {
 *   queueScheduler.schedule(() => console.log('second')); // will not happen now, but will be put on a queue
 *
 *   console.log('first');
 * });
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "first"
 * // "second"
 * ```

export const queue = new QueueScheduler();
